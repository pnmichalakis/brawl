  Human beings are naturally aggressive, competitive creatures.
  <br> 
  Of course, the human beings of today are generally stuck working terrible, boring desk jobs.
  <br>
	This leaves us with a decided disconnect from our competitive, aggressive natures.
  <br>
  Fisticuffs aims to change that.
  <br>
  <br>
  
  The purpose of Fisticuffs is to bring people together in the name of honorable combat.
