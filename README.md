FISTICUFFS


Peter Michalakis - 2014



Human beings are naturally aggressive, competitive creatures, but the human beings of today are generally stuck working terribly boring desk jobs. Fisticuffs aims to change that.


First time users login/are authenticated through their Facebook accounts. Fisticuffs pulls the user's name, profile photo and other assorted information and generates an account, saving those various values to a database. Repeat users login with their Facebook accounts, the information pulled therein is checked against the database so that users' accounts are not duplicated. 

After logging in, users are taken to the main/index page, where a prospective opponent's name and picture are displayed. Users have an option of selecting either "I'm good" and "Let's scrap," indicating, respectively, that the user would not like to fight the prospective opponent or that they would in fact like to engage them in fisticuffs. 

If upon clicking "Let's Scrap," and the prospective opponent has also clicked "Let's Scrap," both users will receive a notification that they have a battle on their hands, and will be able to send one another messages in order to facilitate/plan said combat.
